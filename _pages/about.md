I received my Ph.D in [Electrical Engineering](https://electrical-engineering.uark.edu/index.php) at the University of Arkansas. My passion is to devoting my life to mathematical knowledge and engineering skills, and apply them to solve real-world problems, especially in the electrical and financial domains.

## My work and research
My Ph.D. research focuses on achieving high renewable energy integration in Smart Grids in two aspects: Optimal on-line schedule of the energy sources in the grid, and the quick detection of attacks on the grid. Optimization and detection algorithms based on statistical inference and deep reinforcement learning are applied, resulting in multiple peer-reviewed conference and journal papers.

## My background and history
I have a strong background and enthusiasm in mathematics, especially in statistics. I received by B.A. in [Electronic Engineering Department](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), one of the top two universities in China, focusing on communication theory. I also took courses from statistics during Ph.D. for my research on detection algorithms. In the meantime, I learned reinforcement learning and Python by myself and applied DDPG algorithm to on-line schedule and detection.

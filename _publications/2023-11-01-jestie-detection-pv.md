excerpt: 'The grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems under attack will effect the cybersecurity of the smart grids. A quick detection algorithm is developed by using a hybrid model- and data-driven approach, where the test statistics are formulated by using both the physical model of the PV farm and historical measurements.'

The low latency detection algorithm is developed by designing a generalized cumulative sum (CUSUM) detector with a dynamic watermark, which can detect cyberattacks even if the adversary has full knowledge of the system model. To evaluate the performance of the low latency detection algorithm, we propose to measure the stealthiness of cyberattacks by using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the pre- and post-attack distributions of the test statistics. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can accurately detect cyberattacks with minimum delays.

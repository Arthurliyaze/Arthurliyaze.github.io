To capture the impacts of long-term factors such as aging
effects, inflation, and discounted economic returns, the complexity of
MILP is high due to the long time horizon. A new low-complexity
algorithm is then proposed by using dynamic programming, where
it is shown that the MINLP problem can be transformed into one
that satisfies Bellman’s principal of optimality.

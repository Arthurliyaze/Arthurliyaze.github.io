excerpt: 'The dynamic programming approach for battery schedule has less complexity but is still an off-line optimization which users can not directly apply to their solar panels. Is there a way to use the schedule strategy while running the solar system?'

The scheduling algorithm is developed by using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that can deal with continuous state and action spaces. One of the main contributions of this work is a new DDPG reward function, which is designed based on the unique behaviors of energy systems. The new reward function can guide the scheduler to learn the appropriate behaviors of load shifting and peak shaving through a balanced process of exploration and exploitation. The online algorithm can efficiently learn the behaviors of optimum non-casual off-line algorithms.

The optimum designs are performed by considering the overall cost of the PV system, which usually accounts for a big amount of initial investment, and the aging effects of batteries and solar panels. Practical considerations, such as calendar aging and cycling aging of batteries, inflation of utility cost, and interest rates for investments required for system construction, are considered in the study. A proof of transforming the MINLP problem to a MILP is given.

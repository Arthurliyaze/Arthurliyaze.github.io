excerpt: 'Traditional detection methods of cyberattacks in smart grids focus mainly
on detection accuracy and pay little attention to detection delay. While a
lower detection delay can reduce recovery time, thus minimizing
service interruption or economic losses due to cyberattacks. This paper proposed a redinforcement learning based detection algorithm that achieve very low detection delays with high detection accuracy.'

the algorithm
is developed by using a non-linear dynamic AC system model
with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to capture power grid
state transitions in real-time, while many other works in the
literature use a simplified linear DC model. The DRL detection
algorithm is developed by using a continuous state space deep Qnetwork
(DQN) on the framework of a Markov decision process
(MDP). The MDP state is designed as a sliding window of Rao-statistics
of the AC dynamic state estimation residues. A new reward function is designed to
allow a flexible trade-off between detection delays and detection
accuracy. The delay-accuracy trade-off can be adjusted by tuning
a single parameter in the reward function.
